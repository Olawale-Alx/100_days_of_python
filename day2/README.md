### Day 2


- I learnt about Python data types, type error and type conversion, mathematical operations

- I also made a small Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator

- I learnt Number manipulations and F string in python

- I also made a calculator that asks for our age and assuming that you will ive for 90 years, will print the total number of months, weeks and days you have left

- I then made my day 2 project: *A tip calculator*. This calculates how much you  will pay after calculating your total bill, tip and amount to share per person
